SQL Server triggers are special stored procedures that are executed automatically in response to the database object
,database, and server events.SQL Server provides three type of triggers:
و هو كود بقدر انفذه اوتوماتيك قبل او بعد حدوث حدث معين

.Data manipulation language (DML) triggers which are invoked automatically in response
 to INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE events against tables.

.Data definition language (DDL) triggers which fire in response to CREATE, ALTER,
 and DROP statements. DDL triggers also fire in response to some system stored procedures
 that perform DDL-like operations.

.Logon triggers which fire in response to LOGON events

“Virtual” tables for triggers: INSERTED and DELETED
SQL Server provides two virtual tables that are available specifically for triggers called INSERTED 
and DELETED tables. SQL Server uses these tables to capture the data of the modified row before and after 
the event occurs.

--create trigger after events

CREATE TRIGGER [schema_name.]trigger_name
ON table_name
AFTER  {[INSERT],[UPDATE],[DELETE]}
[NOT FOR REPLICATION]
AS
{sql_statements}


What is an INSTEAD OF trigger
An INSTEAD OF trigger is a trigger that allows you to skip an INSERT, DELETE, or UPDATE statement to a table or
 a view and execute other statements defined in the trigger instead.

CREATE TRIGGER [schema_name.] trigger_name
ON {table_name | view_name }
INSTEAD OF {[INSERT] [,] [UPDATE] [,] [DELETE] }
AS
{sql_statements}
